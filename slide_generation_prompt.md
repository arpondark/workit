**Design Notes for AI:**
*   **Mood:** Trustworthy but energetic. Use rounded corners (modern UI), soft shadows for depth, and plenty of whitespace.
*   **Imagery:** Use high-quality abstract tech backgrounds or diverse people working on laptops in modern workspaces (but keep it not too stock-photo generic).
*   **Typography:** Sans-serif, clean, bold headings (e.g., Inter, Roboto).
